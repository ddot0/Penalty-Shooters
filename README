The task was one of finding the maximum goal scorer in a scenario where a score or miss is determined by the energy  of each player.

We want to measure the starting energy of each player as a given input, and update that property dependent on outcome. So I wrote the function to decrement the strikers’ energies if they score a goal and decrement the goalkeepers energy if a goal is saved. 

Whether a goal is scored or saved is determined by whether or not the striker’s energy level is a factor of the goal keepers’. In the event of both striker’s able to score, Lohia is always favoured as the problem states.

The game is to end when the goalkeeper’s energy is at 1, so I began with a while statement for the function. The solution was tested manually, in the GeeksForGeeks environment and also with a unit test. (Note: I found the implementation of a unit test difficult due to the inclusion of user inputs for the energy levels and test cases, so I discovered input mocking and used this.) Outputs are correct for all variations I tested and those that were included on the GeeksForGeeks site.
